        hello! </br></br>
        i feel as though someone is going to stumble across this file and believe that some of the additions have some sort of malicious intent. i am here to confirm that any references to malware or associated misdemeanor is a JOKE! the sense of humor may be alien to some, but i can confirm that that's all it is- humor. us youngins especially find this kind of thing funny for some reason, i guess- my goal here, aside from learnin some programming, was just to get a laugh out of some friends, and i was successful. this is to say: NO REAL VIRUSES INVOLVED! check if you want: all just html. no intended harm to the internet, the school computer system, or anything is involved or intended. </br></br>
        that being said- hope you got a laugh out of this, too!
